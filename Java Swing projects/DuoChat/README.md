# DuoChat

DuoChat is a WhatsApp clone developed using Java Swing, consisting of two distinct components: server.java and client.java. The application facilitates simultaneous communication between two individuals in a chat-like interface. The server.java file likely manages the server-side operations, handling communication, and ensuring the smooth exchange of messages between the two clients. On the other hand, client.java represents the client-side implementation, providing the user interface and interaction for individuals engaging in the conversation. This project demonstrates the use of Java Swing to create a basic yet functional chat application for a two-person communication system.
